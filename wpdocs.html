      <h2>What is wordpress? What is a CMS?</h2>

<h3>From the official wordpress site:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Software that provides a method of managing your website is commonly called a CMS or "Content Management System". Many blogging software programs are considered a specific type of CMS.
They provide the features required to create and maintain a blog, and can make publishing on the internet as simple as writing an article, giving it a title, and organizing it under (one or more) categories.
While some CMS programs offer vast and sophisticated features, a basic blogging tool provides an interface where you can work in an easy and, to some degree, intuitive manner while it handles the logistics involved in making your composition presentable and publicly available.
In other words, you get to focus on what you want to write, and the blogging tool takes care of the rest of the site management.</p>

<h2>A list of standard aspects of using Wordpress that should be covered</h2>

<h2>Each item includes a description along with a link to learn more</h2>

<h3>How to access the admin interface</h3>

<p>Go to your domain name (such as example.com) plus wp-admin, so example.com/wp-admin. Unless stated otherwise, this is where you will log in using the username and password provided.</p>

<p><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens">Learn more about the admin screen</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>How to manage users, including passwords and emails</h3>

<p>Users can be added at example.com/wp-admin/users.php
There are two different default roles: Administrator and Contributor. In most cases you will want to have only one or two admin users, and then use the contributor role for users that only need to be able to add or update posts on the website. It is important that you limit the number of admin users, because the admin is able to make changes to your website that could cause it to stop working</p>

<h3>How to add posts and pages</h3>

<p>Adding new posts or pages is quite easy, you can just go to the "Posts" or "Pages" menus on the left sidebar in the admin page, and click "Add New". When adding a new post or page it is important that the correct template is selected, and the correct theme is active, otherwise the post or page will not look correct.</p>

<hr />

<h4>How to manage templates when adding a post or a page</h4>

<p>Managing the template for a page or post is important because this is what tells wordpress to do when it displays your content. If the incorrect template is chosen, then the page will not display properly.</p>

<hr />

<h4>How to create drafts, and change the visibility of a post or page</h4>

<p>Creating drafts and changing the visibility of posts and pages can be useful if you want to save your work but you are not ready for content to go live on your site. Changing the status of a post to "draft" means that only you (the admin or contributor who created it) can view, and it will not be visible on the main site. When you change the status to "publish" it will be public and viewable by anyone who access the site.</p>

<h3>How to edit content</h3>

<p>Editing content can be done through the same interface as adding posts or pages, and it can be found through the "All posts" or "All pages" buttons, which are in the same place as the "Add new" buttons. The main editor available, and what most users will use, is a "What You See Is What You Get" editor, which means that it generates the html code for you instead of having to do it by hand.</p>

<p>Here is an in-depth tutorial on how to use the wordpress editor and get the most out of it</p>

<h3>What are plugins, and what are themes? What is possible to do with them?</h3>

<p>Plugins are tools that can be added to wordpress that extend the core functionality of wordpress. This means that a plugin can make wordpress do anything that a regular web application is capable of, limited only by what the plugin author is able to create. Plugins can be free or paid for. Themes also extend wordpress, but they are focused on changing the general look and feel of the website, in addition to adding new functions designed to work together. A theme is much more general than a plugin, although they are both capable of the same things.</p>

<h3>How to update plugins and themes</h3>

<p>Keeping your themes and plugins up-to-date is extremely important. Aside from the fact that updating will usually improve the functionality and add useful features, it will also make your website more secure. Updating promptly means that if an update includes a fix for a security flaw, then your site will be vulnerable for less time. Before updating the core wordpress, however, it should be verified that it is safe to do so with the person who setup the website. Usually this will not be an issue because getflywheel keeps the core wordpress up-to-date automatically.</p>

<h3>Potential issues with this that need to be made clear</h3>

<p>It should be made clear that sometimes updating a theme or a plugin may result in problems, despite efforts to make it safe. If this happens then usually it is easy to roll back to a previous version using getflywheel, and this will restore your site while the issue can be diagnosed.</p>

<h3>Things that can cause other issues</h3>

<p>This is not an issue with getflywheel, however it is important to be careful when modifying the site url, because this may make your wordpress site inaccessible. Therefore the site url should never be modified except by a developer or experienced admin.</p>

<p>Thankfully getflywheel solves this problem by making it impossible to change from the wordpress interface</p>
